Psalm 4
(A psalm by David for the music leader. Use stringed instruments.)
An Evening Prayer
You are my God and protector. Please answer my prayer. I was in terrible distress, but you set me free. Now have pity and listen as I pray. How long will you people refuse to respect me? You love foolish things, and you run after what is worthless. The LORD has chosen everyone who is faithful to be his very own, and he answers my prayers. But each of you had better tremble and turn from your sins. Silently search your heart as you lie in bed. Offer the proper sacrifices and trust the LORD. There are some who ask, "Who will be good to us?" Let your kindness, LORD, shine brightly on us. You brought me more happiness than a rich harvest of grain and grapes. I can lie down and sleep soundly because you, LORD, will keep me safe.
