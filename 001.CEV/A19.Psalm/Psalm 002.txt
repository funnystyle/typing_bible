Psalm 2
The LORD's Chosen King
Why do the nations plot, and why do their people make useless plans? The kings of this earth have all joined together to turn against the LORD and his chosen one. They say, "Let's cut the ropes and set ourselves free!" In heaven the LORD laughs as he sits on his throne, making fun of the nations. The LORD becomes furious and threatens them. His anger terrifies them as he says, "I've put my king on Zion, my sacred hill." I will tell the promise that the LORD made to me: "You are my son, because today I have become your father. Ask me for the nations, and every nation on earth will belong to you. You will smash them with an iron rod and shatter them like dishes of clay." Be smart, all you rulers, and pay close attention. Serve and honor the LORD; be glad and tremble. Show respect to his son because if you don't, the LORD might become furious and suddenly destroy you. But he blesses and protects everyone who runs to him.
