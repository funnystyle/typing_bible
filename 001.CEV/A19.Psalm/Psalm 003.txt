Psalm 3
(Written by David when he was running from his son Absalom.)
An Early Morning Prayer
I have a lot of enemies, LORD. Many fight against me and say, "God won't rescue you!" But you are my shield, and you give me victory and great honor. I pray to you, and you answer from your sacred hill. I sleep and wake up refreshed because you, LORD, protect me. Ten thousand enemies attack from every side, but I am not afraid. Come and save me, LORD God! Break my enemies' jaws and shatter their teeth, because you protect and bless your people.
