Psalm 6
(A psalm by David for the music leader. Use stringed instruments.)
A Prayer in Time of Trouble
Don't punish me, LORD, or even correct me when you are angry! Have pity on me and heal my feeble body. My bones tremble with fear, and I am in deep distress. How long will it be? Turn and come to my rescue. Show your wonderful love and save me, LORD. If I die, I cannot praise you or even remember you. My groaning has worn me out. At night my bed and pillow are soaked with tears. Sorrow has made my eyes dim, and my sight has failed because of my enemies. You, LORD, heard my crying, and those hateful people had better leave me alone. You have answered my prayer and my plea for mercy. My enemies will be ashamed and terrified, as they quickly run away in complete disgrace.
