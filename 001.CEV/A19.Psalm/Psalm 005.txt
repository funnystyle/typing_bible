Psalm 5
(A psalm by David for the music leader. Use flutes.)
A Prayer for Help
Listen, LORD, as I pray! Pay attention when I groan. You are my King and my God. Answer my cry for help because I pray to you. Each morning you listen to my prayer, as I bring my requests to you and wait for your reply. You are not the kind of God who is pleased with evil. Sinners can't stay with you. No one who boasts can stand in your presence, LORD, and you hate evil people. You destroy every liar, and you despise violence and deceit. Because of your great mercy, I come to your house, LORD, and I am filled with wonder as I bow down to worship at your holy temple. You do what is right, and I ask you to guide me. Make your teaching clear because of my enemies. Nothing they say is true! They just want to destroy. Their words are deceitful like a hidden pit, and their tongues are good only for telling lies. Punish them, God, and let their own plans bring their downfall. Get rid of them! They keep committing crimes and turning against you. Let all who run to you for protection always sing joyful songs. Provide shelter for those who truly love you and let them rejoice. Our LORD, you bless those who live right, and you shield them with your kindness.
